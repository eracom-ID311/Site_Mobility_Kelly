      <h1>Future Mobility Concept</h1>
      <p>
        The city is changing. Decades of car-centric urban planning is being
        turned on its head and a simpler, more elegant form of mobility is
        returning to the forefront: the bicycle. Dodging traffic and eliminating
        the dreaded search for parking, e-bikes have made getting around town
        easier than ever and they are only improving. Bringing together modern,
        intuitive design, integrated features and unparalleled performance, one
        revolutionary concept and two new e-bikes represent the next step in
        urban mobility. Whether you’re commuting to work, pedalling to the
        grocery store or just going out for a joy ride, our designers and
        engineers considered every tiny detail to create innovative solutions
        that make navigating the city faster and simpler than ever before.

        <h1>A better more mobile future</h1>
        <p>
          Metropolitan areas are growing and with that growth comes more
          traffic, worse air pollution and greater amounts of CO² released into
          the atmosphere. In cities across the globe, officials and urban
          planners are scrambling to come up with creative ways to address these
          issues, but they need all of the help they can get. To help shape the
          future of transportation, we teamed up with the Technical University
          of Aachen to design a new and innovative solution. Bridging the gap
          between e-bike and car, our future mobility concept presents a
          revolutionary alternative to both the automobile and the bicycle.
          Combining the next generation of lightweight and powerful e-bike
          design with four-wheel stability and storm-proof protection from the
          elements, our Future Mobility Concept represents a decisive step in
          re-imagining how bicycle technology can reclaim space on the streets.
          It is a clean vehicle, a statement, and a sign of what’s to come.

        <h1>Bridging the gap</h1>
        <p>
          We’re so used to jumping in our cars that they often become the
          default choice, but sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, it’s hard not
          to watch with jealousy as cyclists fly by in the bike lane. Yet even
          as the popularity of e-bikes skyrockets in urban areas, 45%* of
          potential users still want a form of transport that is protected from
          wind, rain and snow. Enter our Future Mobility Concept. Designed to
          seamlessly jump from the street to the bike lane, this low-emission
          vehicle merges the best parts of cars and e-bikes into one to make it
          the ultimate daily commuter. It’s fast and stable enough to fly down
          the open road, yet light and agile enough to slide into the bike lane
          when things get backed up. The next step in mobility is here. * Based
          on a McKinsey study of micro mobility

          <h1>Design</h1>
          <p class="gonflable">
            Simple. Precise. Dynamic. Those three maxims have dictated the
            award-winning Canyon design language for years and now they have
            manifested in our new Future Mobility Concept. The futuristic
            aesthetic of the concept blends modern bike and automobile design,
            while the clean, reduced silhouette further communicates the
            lightweight and aerodynamic build of the vehicle. Ultimately, the
            design evokes the idea of urban simplicity and a newer, better way
            of navigating the city – just like the new Precede:ON e-bike.
            Together, they represent a unified design for a more mobile future.

          <h1>Ergonomics</h1>
          <p class="gonflable">
            Similar to a recumbent bicycle, the concept places the rider in a
            comfortable laid-back position with their feet on the pedals. The
            concept is manoeuvred using intuitive side stick steering where two
            joysticks positioned by the rider’s left and right hips turn the
            vehicle through its acute, 7-metre turning radius. The result is a
            comfortable and agile system that makes commuting safe and simple
            all while keeping the rider protected from the elements.

          <h1>Capsule concept</h1>
          <p class="gonflable">
            How do you bring total weather protection to an e-bike? This is the
            question our designers and engineers had to answer with the Future
            Mobility Concept. The solution is a totally-sealable passenger
            compartment surrounded by an innovative, panoramic capsule that
            strikes the perfect blend of form and function. When not sealed to
            protect against the elements, the capsule can be slid forward along
            two rails to open the cockpit up. This ‘open mode’ is great when the
            weather is hot or if the rider wants that fresh-breeze feeling that
            comes with driving a convertible. The capsule even has enough space
            behind the rider to seat a child, load luggage or pack up groceries
            for the ride home. The capsule can then be slid even further forward
            for easy entry and exit of the vehicle.
